# Week 7 - 13) Write the pseudocode for an unweighted graph data structure. You
#              either use an adjacency matrix or an adjacency list approach.
#              Also, write a function to add a new node and a function to add
#              an edge. Following that, implement the graph you have designed in
#              the programming language of your choice. You may use your own
#              linked list from previous labs, the STL LL, or use a simple
#              fixed size array (10 elements would be fine).
