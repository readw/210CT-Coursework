## Summary
This repository is a collection of all my 210CT coursework submissions, as well as all the lab exercises I complete during the week. Each week is split up into both that of Lecture Tasks and Labsheet Tasks, and is represented as such by the folders found above.

All the tasks are normally based around different topics and I have created all solutions in Python, C++ and PHP (this is for personal gain so not all tasks will be completed in this language) so as to show off my programming skills all of the documents are commented making it easier for you to following on.

All Golf-Tasks are shown in a seperate folder and will be in both Python and C++ (these will not be attempted in PHP).

Developing all of this through 3 different languages allows me to demonstrate efficiency of one language compared to the other though as previously mentioned helps personal gain in terms of knowledge around different programming languages.

Below I have stated what each weeks tasks is based off (normally based off the title of the Lab) to give you an understanding of why the tasks that have been completed fit into this category.
