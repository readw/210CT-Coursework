## Summary
This repository is a collection of all my 210CT coursework submission pieces. Each folder represnts the level of the task that was accomplished and the programming language used, whilst each file starts with a number based off of the question that was attempted.

Developing all of this through both Python and C++ different languages allows me to demonstrate efficiency of one language compared to the other though as previously mentioned helps personal gain in terms of knowledge around different programming languages.

Below, I have stated what each weeks tasks is based off (normally based off the title of the Lab) to give you an understanding of why the tasks that have been completed fit into this category.
